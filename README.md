# Failed US Banks FDIC Data

## Description
This project focuses on using SQL queries to analyze data related to failed banks in the United States. The dataset includes key details about each failing bank, such as the bank's name, state, city, acquiring institution, closing date, estimated loss, total assets, and total deposits. This analysis enables us to gain insights on some important factors contributing to bank failures.

## Dataset
The dataset is sourced from kaggle. As stated by Kaggle, the data was obtained from FDIC bank records API and the FDIC Bank List. The data covers a range from October 1, 2020, to July 25, 2023.

## Insights Examined
In this project, I use SQL queries to extract meaningful information from the dataset. Some examples of queries that was performed include:

Retrieved the total number of failed banks in each state.
Identified top 10 acquiring institutions to have taken over most of the failed banks.
Calculated the average estimated loss of failed banks.
Analyzed the distribution of failed banks on a yearly basis since 2000.
Calculated the loss to asset ratio and asset to deposit ratio.
